# [Introduction](#introduction) 

# SHAPE

SHAPE is a fictional gym based in Rotterdam, aiming to promote Outdoor exercise. Due to COVID-19 restrictions gyms have been temporarily closed, leaving many of its clients with no other options to workout. This site will target current clients, introducing a new area where they can Login into their account. It will target also potential costumers, who are curious to know more details about the classes, location and more information about the Trainers.
